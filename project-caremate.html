  <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
  <section class="project-section fade-up">
      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>
        CareMate is a web-based health monitoring platform designed to help families monitor the health conditions of elderly parents remotely. The project addresses challenges faced by busy family members who struggle to consistently track routine health data such as blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol, and medication schedules. Developed for the CodeFest UI/UX Competition, CareMate applies a human-centered innovation approach, ensuring that the solution is grounded in real user problems, validated needs, and practical daily usage scenarios.

    <h2>Process</h2>

    <div class="process-list">
      <div class="process-item">
        <h4>Problem Discovery & Validation</h4>
        <p>
          I initiated the project by identifying real-world problems faced by families with elderly parents, supported by secondary research and contextual analysis. The problem was validated through user observations and literature references related to elderly health monitoring and family caregiving challenges.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="process-item">
        <h4>User Research & Insight Synthesis</h4>
        <p>
          User research was conducted to understand user behavior, pain points, and expectations. Insights from this stage were synthesized into clear problem statements and opportunity areas that guided product direction.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="process-item">
        <h4>Solution Definition & Feature Prioritization</h4>
        <p>
          Based on validated insights, I defined the core solution concept and prioritized features that directly addressed user needs, balancing feasibility, impact, and usability.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="process-item">
        <h4>Wireframing & Product Structuring</h4>
        <p>
          I translated product requirements into low-fidelity wireframes, defining user flows, feature hierarchy, and interaction logic to ensure clarity before entering the visual design phase.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="process-item">
        <h4>Iterative Evaluation</h4>
        <p>
          The solution concept and wireframes were evaluated through feedback sessions, allowing refinements to ensure alignment with user expectations and competition objectives.
        </p>
