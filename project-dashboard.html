      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>
        This project was developed as part of the Dashboard Visualization Competition at GELAR RASA 2024. The project focuses on analyzing Airbnb listing data to uncover pricing patterns, user preferences, and key factors influencing listing performance. My role in this project primarily involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and insight generation, where analytical findings were translated into dashboard requirements. Based on these insights, an interactive dashboard was designed and implemented collaboratively to support data storytelling and business-oriented decision making. The final output is an interactive Looker Studio dashboard that presents analytical results in a clear, structured, and actionable manner.

      <div class="process-item">
        <h4>Data Cleaning & Preparation</h4>
        <p>
          Raw datasets provided by the competition organizers were explored and cleaned to ensure consistency and reliability. This step included handling missing values, merging datasets, and preparing derived variables for analysis.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="process-item">
        <h4>Exploratory Data Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          Exploratory analysis was conducted to identify relationships between listing attributes, pricing, ratings, and user behavior. Patterns and correlations discovered at this stage formed the basis for defining dashboard metrics and visualizations.
        </p>

      <div class="process-item">
        <h4>Insight Definition & Dashboard Planning</h4>
        <p>
          Based on analytical findings, key insights and storytelling goals were defined. These insights guided decisions on what metrics, charts, and interactions should be included in the final dashboard.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="process-item">
        <h4>Dashboard Development & Validation</h4>
        <p>
