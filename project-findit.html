      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>
            The goal of this project was to create a prototype design for a website that simplifies the reporting and searching of lost items within a campus environment. The focus was on implementing the previously planned website design into a functional prototype, ensuring usability and alignment with user needs.
