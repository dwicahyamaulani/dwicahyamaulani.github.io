      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>
        ZOOBEE (Zoom on English and Be Excellent) is an academic project developed as part of the Human-Computer Interaction course, focusing on the design of user-centered and accessible interfaces. The project aimed to explore how interface design can support effective human interaction by considering user behavior, usability principles, and accessibility. Through this project, the interface was designed to ensure that users can interact with the system efficiently, intuitively, and comfortably, aligning with core Human-Computer Interaction concepts.

    <h2>Process</h2>

    <div class="process-list">
      <div class="process-item">
        <h4>Problem Identification</h4>
        <p>
          Identified relevant problems related to user interaction and accessibility as the foundation of the project. This phase focused on understanding how users interact with digital interfaces and determining challenges that could be addressed through effective UI/UX design.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="process-item">
        <h4>User Research</h4>
        <p>
          Conducted user research to explore the needs, behaviors, and expectations of the target users. Insights gathered from this phase were used to define design requirements and ensure the interface aligned with Human–Computer Interaction principles.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="process-item">
        <h4>UI Design</h4>
        <p>
          Translated user requirements into a structured visual interface using Figma. The design process focused on clarity, accessibility, and ease of interaction, ensuring that the interface could be effectively accessed and understood by users.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="process-item">
        <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
        <p>
          Tested the completed design with representative users to evaluate usability, interaction flow, and overall user experience. This phase helped identify potential usability issues and interaction barriers within the interface.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="process-item">
        <h4>Evaluation</h4>
        <p>
          Analyzed the results of usability testing to assess the effectiveness of the interface. Feedback from users was used to refine and improve the design, ensuring better alignment with user needs and Human-Computer Interaction standards.
